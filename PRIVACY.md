Privacy Policy for Aegis

Last updated: Nov. 13th, 2024

1. Introduction

Aegis ("the bot") is a Discord bot that monitors and detects potentially toxic content within a server's messages to maintain a positive community environment. This privacy policy describes what data we collect, how it is used, and the steps we take to protect user privacy.

2. Data Collection

The bot may collect and process the following types of data:

    User Messages: Content of messages sent within Discord servers where the bot is active, solely to identify potential toxic content.
    User Identifiers: Usernames and user IDs, collected only when necessary for moderation or logging.
    Command Inputs: User inputs from commands, such as changing settings for the bot (e.g., threshold adjustments, warning message updates).

3. Purpose of Data Collection

Data is collected to:

    Detect and notify users of potentially toxic language in real-time.
    Log actions for moderation purposes within the server, such as message toxicity reports.
    Respond to user commands, including setting adjustments and bot interactions.

4. Data Storage

Message logs and data related to toxicity detection are stored securely on a local machine operated by the bot owner. These logs are not automatically deleted and may be retained indefinitely unless a specific deletion request is made by a server administrator.

5. Data Sharing

We do not share, sell, or distribute any collected data with third parties. Data is accessible only to server administrators (upon request, which may be accepted or denied at the discretion of the bot owner) and the bot owner.

6. User Control and Rights

    Request Data Deletion: Server administrators may request deletion of specific data logs by contacting the bot owner at @midnightdoggo19. This requests may be accepted or denied by the owner.
