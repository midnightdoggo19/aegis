Terms of Service for Aegis

Last updated: Nov. 13th, 2024
1. Acceptance of Terms

By inviting or using Aegis ("the bot") in a Discord server, you agree to comply with and be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree to these terms, you must remove the bot from your server and discontinue use.
2. Bot Functionality

Aegis is designed to detect potentially toxic content within messages to help maintain a positive environment in Discord servers. The bot generates log entries which are used for debugging and moderation purposes.
3. Data Collection and Use

The bot collects and logs message content, user identifiers, and command inputs strictly for functionality related to toxicity detection, notifications, and moderation:

    Message Content: Analyzed to detect toxicity and respond as appropriate.
    User Identifiers: Collected solely to attribute actions or messages to specific users when needed.
    Command Inputs: Logged to enable functionality adjustments (e.g., threshold or warning message updates).

All logs are stored securely on the bot owner's local machine and are not deleted automatically.
4. Data Storage and Security

Data logged by the bot is stored on a local machine operated by the bot owner. Data is not shared with any third parties and is only accessible to the bot owner and authorized administrators of the servers where the bot is active.
5. User Responsibilities

Users and administrators of servers using Aegis agree to:

    Use the Bot Responsibly: The bot must be used in accordance with Discord’s Community Guidelines and Terms of Service.
    Respect Privacy and Data Policies: Users must respect the data collection and usage policies as described in the bot’s Privacy Policy.
    Request Data Removal if Needed: Administrators may contact the bot owner to request deletion of specific logs if necessary.

6. Limitations of Liability

The bot owner is not liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages resulting from the use of the bot. The bot is provided "as is," and the bot owner makes no warranties regarding its functionality, accuracy, or availability.
7. Changes to Terms

The bot owner reserves the right to update these Terms of Service at any time. Changes will be posted, and continued use of the bot constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.
8. Contact Information

For questions, data deletion requests, or further information, please contact the bot owner at @midnightdoggo19.
